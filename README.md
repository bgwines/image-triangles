### todo
* Why is the area wrong for the top right corner? Could be a problem with area fn or with Diagrams laying them out improperly. 
* Rasterization for triangles.
Note, this is implemented but loops without stop for seed #713314263. generates 500 triangles, filters the 200 smallest
Also indexOOBs for seed 426958934, 100 traingles no sort. Seems to be integer overflow, but that doesn't make much sense
* Cmdline interface that lets you set number of triangles, and smallness
* Pointy triangle filter
* Confirm diagrams is rendering triangles in the correct places.
* Cache transformations to the colors library
* Hip has a map transformation. It also depends on the colours library, does it use it?
* Check that hip colors are srgb
* Think about opacity. What if everything was completely opaque? What should we do with areas that arenâ€™t 100% covered at the end?
