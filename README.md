### todo
    * Why is the area wrong for the top right corner?
    * Rasterization for triangles
    * Cmdline interface that lets you set number of triangles, and smallness
    * Pointy triangle filter
    * Confirm diagrams is rendering triangles in the correct places.
    * Cache transformations to the colors library
    * Hip has a map transformation. It also depends on the colours library, does it use it?
    * Check that hip colors are srgb
    * Think about opacity. What if everything was completely opaque? What should we do with areas that arenâ€™t 100% covered at the end?
