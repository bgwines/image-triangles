### todo
- [x] Confirm diagrams is rendering triangles in the correct places.
- [x] Cache transformations to the colors library
- [x] Hip has a map transformation. It also depends on the colours library, does it use it?
- [x] In addition, hip has interfaces to arrays that support operations like map
- [x] Check that hip colors are srgb
- [ ] Think about opacity. What if everything was completely opaque? What should we do with areas that arenâ€™t 100% covered at the end?
- [ ] The diagram needs a final bounding box that's the size of the picture that it comes from.
